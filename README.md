Abstract:

Arnold and Arvanitis (2020) introduced a novel bivariate conditionally specified distribution, which is a distribution in which dependence between two random variables is established by defining the distribution of one variable conditional on the other. This novel conditioning regime was achieved through the use of survival functions, and the approach was termed the accelerated failure conditionals model. In their work, the conditioning framework was constructed using the exponential distribution. Although further generalization was proposed, challenges emerged in deriving the necessary and sufficient conditions for valid joint survival functions. The present study achieves such generalization, extending the conditioning framework to encompass distributional families whose marginal densities may exhibit unimodality and skewness, moving beyond distributional families whose marginal densities are non-increasing. The resulting models are fully specified through closed-form expressions for their moments, with simulations implemented using either a copula-based procedure or the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm. Empirical applications to two datasets, each featuring variables which are unimodal and skewed, demonstrate that the models with flexible, non-monotonic marginal densities yield a superior fit relative to those models with marginal densities restricted to monotonically decaying forms.
